# CPS-Tester
CPS-Tester app using Java Swing ⚡⚡⚡



This application is my other big project besides [HelloWinter](https://github.com/konraaadcz/HelloWinter). To run it, run the `start.bat` file 

You will need the latest version of Java to use it, so if you don't have it yet, [install](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) it!
